FastX is a utility you can use to get a remote desktop on CHPC's
interactive nodes. CHPC has [instructions
here](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/fastx2.php#utwc).


To get setup on Redwood, use one of the following links (authenticate
with CHPC credentials). You must be on campus, using EIHG VPN (Full
Tunnel), or Campus VPN.

'*Applications*' folder):
